## Terminologies

- **Collections:** The collections that are created inside of the Indelible Labs platform that are **NOT** yet deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Contracts:** The ERC721a Contract that was generated from the collection and deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Layers:** These are groups of traits (e.g. of layers: Head, Face, Body, Background). A trait from each layer is selected in the minting process to create the final image that is rendered.
- **Traits:** These are image files (e.g. of traits: McHat, Pink Nouns, Zombie, Blue). They are stored inside a layer and given a rarity rank which tells the contract how many times each trait within each layer is to be selected.
