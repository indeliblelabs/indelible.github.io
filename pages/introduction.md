## Introduction

[Indelible Labs](https://indelible.xyz) is the first No-Code platform to create On-Chain NFTs.

Our mission is to make on-chain NFT collections easier as well as affordable to create, utilize, and grow while simultaneously educating the public about on-chain technology.

Currently the platform is token gated by [OnChainKevin (OCK)](https://opensea.io/collection/onchainkevin) meaning that to connect to the Indelible Labs tool, you must have one of these tokens in that specific wallet you will connect with.

### Benefits of OCK Token

- Access to Indelible Labs No-Code tool.
- Automatically added to every allow list from every collection that comes out of indelible labs ***(must hold the token for 15 days in your minting wallet)***
- Specific roles in our amazing [Discord community](https://discord.gg/indelible).


## Features

- 100% ON-CHAIN!

## Terminologies

- **Collections:** The collections that are created inside of the Indelible Labs platform that are **NOT** yet deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Contracts:** The ERC721a Contract that was generated from the collection and deployed to the Ethereum Mainnet.
- **Layers:** These are groups of traits (e.g. of layers: Head, Face, Body, Background). A trait from each layer is selected in the minting process to create the final image that is rendered.
- **Traits:** These are image files (e.g. of traits: McHat, Pink Nouns, Zombie, Blue). They are stored inside a layer and given a rarity rank which tells the contract how many times each trait within each layer is to be selected.
