## Overview

Congratulations! Your contract deployed successfully! To enable the world to mint your tokens, follow these essential steps:

1. Click "Upload to Contract" to upload all layers.
2. If you have declared any "Link Traits," upload them.
3. If "Allow list" is activated, upload the list to your contract.
4. Toggle the desired minting option.

### Generative Colletion's Contract Managament 

#### Uploading the Layers

After a successful deployment, you will be immediately directed to a dedicated page for managing your contract. 

Here, you can upload the layers to your contract on the Ethereum blockchain. **Before moving forward, ensure all layers are uploaded. No further actions are allowed until this step is complete.** This process prevents overwhelming the blockchain with too much data at once, so your art is not immediately added to the contract upon deployment.

Upon deployment, you will see a list of your layers. At this point, click "Upload To Contract" for each layer. This writes the traits for that layer into your contract. *After completing this step, the attention icon will change to a checkmark.* Once all layers are uploaded, your art will be fully on-chain (See Figure 16).
