## Contribute

We are far from perfect, so if you find any typos, errors, find something missing or simply have a better way to explain or describe something in the docs you are welcome to submit a PR with your change.

All pages are markdown, and they can be found in the `./pages` folder where you will find the naming according to each section in the live docs.
